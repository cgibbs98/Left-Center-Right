# Left-Center-Right
A simulation of the game Left-Center-Right written in C

This program has been tested using the GCC compiler for Ubuntu.
To use, simply compile lcr.c with GCC and enjoy.

NOTE: Editing the config.txt file other than values or adding the wrong values for each parameter can (and likely will) cause unintended consequences when the program is being used. Edit this file within the program instead.
